Mainly there are three datasets.

1. Sensor data
2. Activity labels ( represented by activity_name_ in tidy_data.txt)
3. Subject ID.

In the final dataset,

Activity label has been represented by column activity_name_ and consists of 6 activities

WALKING

WALKING_UPSTAIRS

WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

SITTING

STANDING

LAYING



The final sensor data(tidy data) consists of original data columns that contain mean and standard deviation values . It consists of the following columns:

"activity_name_"

"subject"

"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"

"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"

"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"

"tBodyAcc-std()-X"

Variable units

Activity variable is factor type. Subject variable is integer type. All the other variables are numeric type.
